### 3/22/23

Collaborated on wireframe of the project as well as started on the api documentation.

### 3/23/23

We tried to figure out how to obtain the data from the api. Consulted with Riley about our project, figured out how to embed the playlist.

## 3/27/23

We tried to follow along with Curtis' video doing authentication but we still couldn't figure out how to get it working. We decided that we needed to see tomorrows lecture to figure out the missing pieces of our authentication. We also worked a little bit on the SQL tables in the migrations folder.

## 3/29/23

Started trying to figure out the API endpoint for our history feature.

## 3/30/23

We made progress on the endpoints for our project. We also made some changes to the weather moodel.

## 4/3/23

The group was able to finish playlist and weather endpoints. There was also a cleanup of some unneccesary things within the code.

## 4/4/23

We began to create the main page. We also spent most of the day trying to install tailwind. A login card was also implemented into the mainpage.

## 4/5/23

Progress on the main and login pages.

## 4/6/23

Taylor got the frontend authorization to work. The login and logout was completed and a history page and button was added.

## 4/17/23

We each made a unit test for the project as we were required to do so. Taylor was also able to make the embedded spotify playlist dynamic.

## 4/18/23

We were looking at two different APIs for weather. We decided and updated the mainpage with the weather API.

## 4/19/23

We watched Taylor implement the spotify player based on what the current weather was from openweatherAPI. We then decided to switch from tailwind to bootstrap as we were having some difficulties with it.

## 4/20/23

We implemented a geolocation API so that the user could just click the button and have a location while still having the option to manually type in a city and state.

## 4/27/23

We were playing around with stylization on the main page. We added borders to buttons and inputs, added a default text inside the input box asking for the user to input a city, and played around with putting an image in the background.
